Array/list numbers could be a mixture of positives, negatives also zeroes .

Input >> Output Examples
adjacentElementsProduct([1, 2, 3]); ==> return 6
Explanation:
The maximum product obtained from multiplying 2 * 3 = 6, and they're adjacent numbers in the array.
adjacentElementsProduct([9, 5, 10, 2, 24, -1, -48]); ==> return 50
