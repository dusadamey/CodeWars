# Codewars - Python Solutions

My solutions for Codewars problems are written using `Python 3.6.0` and unittests are run using pytest.

* Codewars supports `Python 3.6.0`.
* Since `Python 3` support is relatively new to Codewars, a lot of the `Python` katas are only available for `Python 2`. But, It's 2020 where we use only `Python 3`.
